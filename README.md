# Singapore botanic gardens dataset
Dataset I collected on the balmy afternoon of 12/18/2017 during my visit to Singapore on the sidelines of the DLS workshop hosted by NUS.
(More specifically the _healing_ section of the [Ethnobotany garden](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/news/2018/6/new-ethnobotany-garden-with-complementary-centre-for-ethnobotany-opens-at-the-singapore-botanic-gardens)
